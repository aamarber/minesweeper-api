## Launch Instructions

Run the next commands in order to launch the API locally:

```bash
npm run start
```

That command will launch the API in the port specified in the .env file, which is 9988. Remember that if that port is under usage, you can change it changing the value of the variable inside that file:

```bash
API_PORT=9988
```

If it's the first time you've downladed or you updated the code of the API, remember to also execute the next command:

```bash
npm i
```
